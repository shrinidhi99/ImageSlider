# ImageSlider
---
An app that contains a list of my favourite cricketers. The front-end is implemented using [ViewPager](https://developer.android.com/training/animation/screen-slide?authuser=1) and for efficient loading and caching of images, [Picasso](https://github.com/square/picasso) has been used.
